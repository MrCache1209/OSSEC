# How to add agents
# Document classification: Confidential
# Requirements
# UDP/1514 needs to be allowed both ways between endpoint and FIM (OSSEC Manager) host.

*************Agent installation on Linux Endpoint************************

# Send agent authentication key to the client.
# wget -q -O - http://www.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic | sh      {This is to add the atomic repository on linux agents, which works for all, so binaries would be downloaded automatically during step 2 and the current version is 3.7.0)   OR For anything other than CentOS use  wget -q -O - http://www.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic | sudo bash  
  sudo yum update  OR sudo apt-get update
# If this does work follow the steps below,
# Download the atomic release from the following link https://updates.atomicorp.com/channels/atomic/centos/7/x86_64/RPMS/atomic-release-1.0-23.el7.art.noarch.rpm
# This is to install the atomic repo, makes the installation easy :) 
# sudo rpm -ivh atomic-release-1.0-23.el7.art.noarch.rpm
# yum update 
# Next we are going to install ossec server v3.6.0-12032 currently this the most stable version, although at the time of your installation it might change. Note: Ossec   Manager and agent version should match. It should be excatly the same Number to number otherwise tehy won't communicate.

# yum install ossec-hids-3.6.0-12032.el7.art.x86_64.rpm

# The package manager may differ on various unix systems, (This will map all the dependencies as well)
  -> For CentOS yum install ossec-hids-agent
  -> For others apt-get install ossec-hids-agent
  -> If the steps above donâ€™t work,download the binaries and install them. Although, I would not recommend doing a manual install.
     ->Wget https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/archive/3.6.0.tar.gz
     -> sudo yum group install "Development Tools"
     -> yum install zlib-devel
     -> yum install yum install pcre2-devel
     -> tar -xzf 3.6.0.tar.gz
  -> cd 3.6.0
  -> ./install
# Run the following /var/ossec/bin/ossec-configure
  1- What kind of installation do you want (server, agent, local, hybrid or help)? Agent 
  2- Setting up the installation environment. /var/ossec
  3- Configuring the OSSEC HIDS.
  3.1- Do you want e-mail notification? (y/n) [y]: NO
  3.2- Do you want to run the integrity check daemon? (y/n) [y]: YES 
  3.3- Do you want to run the rootkit detection engine? (y/n) [y]: NO
  3.4- Do you want to enable active response? (y/n) [y]: YES
  3.4.1- Do you want to enable the firewall-drop response? (y/n) [y]: NO
  3.4.2- Do you want to add more IPs to the white list? (y/n)? [n]: NO
  3.5- Do you want to enable remote syslog (port 514 udp)? (y/n) [y]: NO
  5..Run /var/ossec/bin/manage_agent 
  6.. Select the option to I to insert the key, copy paste the client key  and quit
  ->If it gives an error like this, 
       ->Use touch /var/ossec/queue/rids/sender 
       ->repeat step 6
       -> Restart ossec agent /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
  

# Overwrite the contents of the /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf with the configuration file that has been supplied for linux agents  (ossec.conf). Make changes to the server IP, change it to the Ip of the syslog server where the manager is installed. Save changes.
# Copy the agent.conf file to /var/ossc/etc/shared/
# Run  /var/ossec/bin/ossec-agentd start | /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
# if everything is configure properly Check /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log for logs and this should be populated.
 

#  Limitations
   Newly installed agents have OSSEC's ossec.conf file, which needs to be manually overwritten for each host. The agent.conf file that is propagated from the              manager   doesn't overwrite local ossec.conf file. That is, local ossec.conf file has precedence over agent.conf, that's why local ossec.conf needs to be              modified on each agent.
   
****************Agent installation on Windows Endpoint************************

# Copy the authentication string from the server  
# Download the windwos bianary from the follwing link, https://updates.atomicorp.com/channels/atomic/windows/ossec-agent-win32-3.6.0-12032.exe
# Note we are using v3.6.0-12032 match the ossec manager and the agent version and then install it.  
# Launch the .exe file and exclude IIS log monitoring.
# Install the package
# Once the ossec agent starts enter the Server IP and the Auth key and save
# Before starting the agent, go to the OSSEC Manager/Syslog server and run a tcpdump to monitor port 1514 
# Then go to the agent and start agent
# Check log file for possible errors, you can open teh log file from view> view logs
# Scroll to the EOF if it says Log collector started pid:whatever and on the manager console if the tcp dump shows logs orginating from the same IP with variable length then the authentication is successful. Another way to verify the authentication is /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -l the IP should have an Active status.

# NOTE : If the agent log file says 4101 error that means either it is a firewall issue or the versions differ. If the versions differ (that is the agent adn manager are running diffrent versions) then the tcpdump on the manager on port 1514 would show udp packets with length 73 originating from that particular agent IP.

# Copy the contents from the agent-ossec.conf and paste them in the ossec.conf, view>view config, crtl+A and paste.
# copy the agent.conf file and go to programfielsx86>ossec-agent>shared and paste.
# Restart the OSSEC mmanager if the IP disappears add the IP in and restart again. This will update teh configuration file.
# Check the log file again to see if the log collecotr has started, if yes, All set :) 

# Limitations
  Newly installed agents have OSSEC's ossec.conf file, which needs to be manually overwritten for each host. The agent.conf file that is propagated from the manager     doesn't overwrite local ossec.conf file. That is, local ossec.conf file has precedence over agent.conf, that's why local ossec.conf needs to be modified on each       agent.
